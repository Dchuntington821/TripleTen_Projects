<b> Project Description </b> 

Game sales data has been provided to determine which game genres and gaming systems will be best to advertise to each of three distinct regions for the next year in-order to create an efficient and effective marketing strategy.

<b> EDA </b>

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on both game genre and gaming system sales, as well as their associated critic scores data to determine three things:

1. Which game genres are most popular according to region?
2. Which gaming systems are most popular according to region?
3. What is the most effective genre and system to market to each region?

<b>Hypothesis Testing:</b>

Tested two Hypothesis.
1. Average user score for Xbox One is the same as the average user score for PC.
2. Average user score for the Action and Sports genres are the same.

Hypothesis Test Results:

1. p-value = 0.014. The Null Hypothesis is Rejected
2. p-value= 0.158. The Null Hypothesis can't be rejected


<b> Final Project Results </b> 

Clearly determined what game genres and gaming systems should be marketed to each of the three regions for the coming year.
