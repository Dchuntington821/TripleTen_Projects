<b> Project Description </b> 

This was the first Machine Learning project I completed. The goal of this project was to build a classification model that can accurately predict the type of mobile plan a customer was subscribed to, that accuracy score had to be at least 0.75. One dataset was provided. 

<b> Data Cleaning </b>

Dealt with any missing or duplicate values.

<b> Data Pre-Processing </b>

The only pre-processing necessary in this task was to split the data into a training, validation, and testing sets.

<b> Model Training and Selection </b>

1. Random Forest Classifier - Sklearn
2. Logistic Regression - Sklearn

<b> Results </b>

Out of the two models, the Random Forest Classifier had the highest accuracy score of 0.81.
