<b> Project Description: </b>

The company, Megaline, offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. Five data sets are provided containing different types of customer and plan information.

<b> Project Plan: </b>

Analyze how the users of each megaline plan use their plans; how much revenue is brought in by each plan on average, how many messages, calls, minutes, and data the users of each plan use per month. Complete two hypothesis tests to test these two hypothesis';

1. The monthly averages of each plan are the same.
2. The average revenue of the NY-NJ area is the same as other areas.

<b> Important Findings </b>

1. Users of the surf plan tend to exceed their plans limits, especially in minutes and megabyte usage which causes them to be charged additional fees. Ultimate plan users tend to stay within their plans limits.
2. Ultimate plan users tend to use more internet (megabyte consumption) in fewer sessions than the surf plan users.
3. Ultimate plan users send more messages on average than the surf plan users, this is one area where the surf plan users tend to stay more within their plans limits and avoid additional fees.
4. For users, the surf plan is likely the better choice and will likely cost them less over time. Though they get charged additional fees when they exceed their plans limits, their monthly average is still lower than the cost of the ultimate plan.
5. For the company, the surf plan seems to bring in more revenue overall. This is due to the fact that there are more than twice the amount of surf users in the data than ultimate users. It's likely in the companies' best interest to look into how they can increase the number of ultimate plan users. With more ultimate users, the monthly revenue would quickly exceed that of surf users.

<b> Hypothesis Test Results </b>

1. The p-value is: 0.0005476858128530602. We reject the null hypothesis that the monthly average revenue of each plan are the same
   
3. The p-value is: 0.004477811025531896. We reject the null hypothesis that the average revenue of each of the NY-NJ area are the same as other areas
