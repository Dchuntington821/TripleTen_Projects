# TripleTen_Projects
This repository contains most of the projects I completed during my studies in TripleTen's Data Science Bootcamp.

A more thorough description along with the results of the project is provided in each of the project directories.



| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Instacart Analysis | Analyze data instacart data to find trends and patterns to determine how customers are using instacart. |
| 2 | Megaline EDA Hypothesis Test | Perform an EDA on data from the cellular provider, Megaline to determine how subscribers are using their plans. This EDA included analysis on revenue per plan type and a Hypothesis Test which checked for a statistical significance in average revenue between two regions.  |
| 3 | Games Analysis | Analyze trends in popular game types and gaming platforms to determine the most effective marketing strategy for the next year. |
| 4 | Taxi EDA Hypothesis Test| Find the top ten dropoff locations between taxi companies and visualize the amount of trips differing companies take. Run a hypothesis test to check for a stastically significant difference between routes on rainy and clear days.|
| 5 | Megaline Machine Learning | Build a Classification Model that can predict the cellular plan a customer has. Final Model must have an accuracy score of at least 0.75 |
| 6 | Beta Bank Machine Learning | Build a Regression Model that predicts if a client will close their account soon. Final Model must have the highest F1 score. |
| 7 | Oily Giant Machine Learning | Perform an EDA for three different regions where OilyGiant operates oil wells. Build a model that can accurately predict the reserve volume in new wells. Use bootstrapping and risk evaluation to determine the most profitable region with the lowest risk. |
| 8 | Zyfra Machine Learning | Perform an EDA and create a prototype predictive model that accurately predicts the amount of gold recovered at different stages of extraction. |
| 9 | Rusty Bargain Machine Learning | Using standard and gradient boosted methods, build a predictive model that produces accurate predictions for the price of vehicles while minimizaing both training and prediction time. |
| 10 | Sweet Lift Taxi Machine Learning | Build a time series regression model that accurately predicts the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Engineer features so that the RMSE is no less than 48. |
| 11 | Film Sentiment Analysis | Perform an EDA on the data.  Process IMDB movie reviews through normalizing, tokenizing, lemmatizing and completing TF_IDF transformations. Build a predictive model that can classify reviews as either positive or negative. F1 score must be at least 0.85. |
| 12 | Final Project Prototype Machine Learning |  Perform an EDA on the data and build a prototype Machine learning model for the company, Interconnect. The company is interested in knowing which of it's clients may soon churn out so they can offer them targeted discounts and promotions. The final model must accurately predict if a customer will soon cancel their services. Maxamize the AUC_ROC and Accuracy Scores.|
| 13 | Collaborative Coding Competition | Work in a team of four to build a web-scraper that scrapes movie and actor data on the top 250 movies on the IMDB website. Formulate three analytical questions and perform an EDA to answer these questions. Create a presentation and present the construction of the web-scraper and the findings of the EDA to a panel of judges. |
| 14 | App Deployment Project | Perform an EDA with data visualizations. Using render, create an interactive web-based application. This project is in a separate repository: https://github.com/Dchuntington821/Sprint-4-Project |
