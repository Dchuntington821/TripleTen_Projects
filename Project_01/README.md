<b> Project Description </b>

The goal for this project is to analyze several datasets containing information on instacart orders to determine exactly how customers are using Instacart. Five data sets were provided to perform an EDA.

Some of the key questions addressed include:
1. When are users most active?
2. Why types of orders do they make (large or small)?
3. How often to repeating customers make orders?
4. What is instacarts peak days/times?

Key finding: 
In general, people are using instacart for quick in-between shopping trips on weekends but sometimes during business days as well. This is clear as the average order size is ten items and most of the time those items are perishables. This finding answers all of the questions above.
